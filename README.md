## Features

- **List Files**: Returns a list of uploaded files by sending a GET request to `/getFiles`.
- **Get File**: Retrieves the content of a specific file by sending a GET request to `/getFile` with the filename as a query parameter.
- **Modify File**: Updates the content of an existing file by sending a PUT request to `/modifyFile` with the filename and new content in the request body.
- **Delete File**: Deletes a file by sending a DELETE request to `/deleteFile` with the filename as a query parameter.
